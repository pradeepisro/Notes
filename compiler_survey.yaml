- Loop Rotation
  author: Michael Wolfe(Oregon Graduate Center, Department of Computer Science and Engineering)
  tldr: This paper describes a new transformation technique for loops. This maps a specific kind of loop called systolic loop on to a Distributed Memory Message Passing multiprocessor(DMMP)

- Loop Skewing
  author: Michael Wolfe(Department of Computer Science, UIUC)
  tldr: Loop skewing is a transformation technique to derive wavefront method of execution of nested loops. The wavefront method is used to execute nested loop in parallel and vector architectures.
